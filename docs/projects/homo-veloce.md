## Comprehensive Human Biomechanical Modeling for Sprint Performance Optimization

This repository contains the implementation of a comprehensive framework for developing an advanced human body metrics model specifically tailored for sprint performance optimization, with particular focus on 400m events.

## Project Overview

The Holocene Human project aims to create a sophisticated system integrating anthropometric measurements, biomechanical analysis, physiological parameters, and performance metrics to construct a holistic digital representation of the human male body in athletic contexts. The goal is to establish predictive relationships between body metrics and athletic performance, culminating in a specialized language learning model (LLM) capable of providing expert-level insights for performance optimization.

## Core Concepts and Theoretical Frameworks

### Integrated Biomechanical Modeling

Our approach integrates multiple biomechanical modeling paradigms:

- **Musculoskeletal Modeling**: Implementation of Hill-type muscle models combined with rigid body dynamics to simulate muscle forces, joint torques, and body segment movements during sprint activities.
- **Energy Systems Modeling**: Mathematical representation of ATP-PC, glycolytic, and oxidative energy systems with differential equations tracking substrate utilization, fatigue accumulation, and recovery kinetics.
- **Neuromuscular Control**: Optimization-based control strategies using both feedforward and feedback mechanisms to replicate human motor control patterns in sprint events.

### Performance Prediction Framework

The project implements several complementary frameworks for performance prediction:

- **Deterministic Models**: Physics-based simulations solving equations of motion with measured body parameters and force inputs.
- **Statistical Inference**: Bayesian networks and hierarchical models capturing dependencies between physiological capabilities and performance outcomes.
- **Machine Learning Approaches**: Gradient-boosting and deep learning models trained on extensive datasets to identify non-linear relationships between metrics and performance.

### Knowledge Distillation Pipeline

A key innovation is our knowledge distillation approach that transfers insights from computationally expensive simulations to lightweight models for real-time analysis:

- **Teacher-Student Architecture**: Complex physics-based solvers (teachers) distill knowledge into neural network models (students) through specialized training regimes.
- **Performance-Interpretability Trade-off Management**: Maintains interpretability while achieving near-solver-level accuracy through constrained model architectures.
- **Incremental Learning System**: Continues to improve as new data becomes available without forgetting previously learned relationships.
